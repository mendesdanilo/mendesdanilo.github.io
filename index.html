                            <p>Yesterday I was very hungry throughout the day. Went to bed at night, felt my pulse in my stomach for a while. Then stood up quiclky to go pee, and I think my blood pressure was low, so felt quite a bit dizzy for a few seconds.</p>
                            <p>Thought about eating an apple or something. Ate some salt, drank some tea and went to sleep. Woke up fine, remembered my dreams. Let's see how today goes.</p>

                        <p>Just finished Ezekiel. Deep.</p>
                        <p>Father, mother, "friend"...so unfortunate...it feels like there is no trust anywhere.</p>
                        <p>The one who stalks you online is one of your "friends" or the far away stranger.</p>
                        <p>'One basic truth can be used as a foundation for a mountain of lies, and if we dig down deep enough in the mountain of lies, and bring out that truth, to set it on top of the mountain of lies; the entire mountain of lies will crumble under the weight of that one truth, and there is nothing more devastating to a structure of lies than the revelation of the truth upon which the structure of lies was built, because the shock waves of the revelation of the truth reverberate, and continue to reverberate throughout the Earth for generations to follow, awakening even those people who had no desire to be awakened to the truth.' - Delamer Duverus</p>

                            <p>It is very hard to cope with the fact that your own family are monsters and are not on your side.</p>
                            <p>On monday this woman from the neighborhood made a direct talk to me saying "Vagabond! Poor little cat!"</p>
                            <p>The scriptures have been helping me to cope with such a monstrosity. My father says the Bible is not a good reading and wants me to stop, he wants me to read something else. Can you believe this ?</p>
                            <p>Is this some type of macabre deal they made with the masons back in the years ? "Let's have a child and make him a slave too"</p>

                            <p>After yesterday's weird talk with a friend, this morning it came to my mind that all this persecution can also be because of the fact that I once betrayed. The drug arrest incident in the USA. Betrayal is a bad and serious issue, I can see that.</p>
                            <p>So am I paying the price of betrayal ?</p>
                            <p>Am I being governed by the Roman and Pharaonic gods ?</p>
                            <p>This mistake is 18 years old, am I still unstrustworthy ?</p>
                            <p>Once a betrayer, always a betrayer ?</p>

                            <h3>Idolatry ?</h3>
                            <h5>By Danilo Mendes</h5>
                            <p>Maybe keep this in english for now so I can practice a little bit.</p>
                            <p>Was sad by the email exchange with a friend, even himself is showing his Pharaonic roots.</p>
                            <p>More and more isolated, more and more people lost. If not with the Creator, then who could we count on ?</p>
                            <p>This can only be a sci-fi theater, literally unreal.</p>
                            <p>Now, in this picture, is this idolatry ? I can see the trinity, Seth, Isis and Horus. Interestingly enough, when it rains a lot and it floods inside the house, that's exactly where the water comes out the strongest and it literally floods the floor, exactly where these statues are and also where the two Isis' eggs are...quite amazing if you think about it.</p>
                            <p>Really like Wikipedia's definition of "faith":

                            <p>While cooking some eggs, heard a strange noise coming from the living room, and when I went to see it, there was a pigeon in the living room.</p>
                            <p>Luckily I recorded it, and while I was helping her leave, it came to my mind that this was indeed a message from the Creator.</p>

                            <p>At the job, they don't give me any tasks anymore, I am not learning anything, not following any project. Yesterday two colleagues called me to simple change a password from an account.</p>
                            <p>Today the JW guy messaged me saying that I have been studying a lot lately and sent me an article... of course they know I have been studying, they hacked me.</p>
                            <p>Let's see how longer this goes...</p>

                                <p>Just wanted to leave it here that on my bday, all my 3 female cousins sang on the top of their lungs the final birthday song "com quem será" and it was very weird watching them sing from the top of their lungs, and the part of "with whom" the silence prevailed of course, because they don't want me to marry, they want me to know that they do do not allow me to marry. Like one poor little perpetrator in Lisbon said in one of the directed conversations in the gym's bathroom: "girlfriend ? not allowed!"</p>
                                <p>This is why they put couples in front of me, the message is: "we have couples but you won't"</p>
                                <p>Like I want or care anyway...</p>

                                <p>Recorded a couple of videos this week, and noticed that since tuesday (went to take my grandma to the doctor) the couples narrative has strangely increased again.</p>
                                <p>Last night specially, coming back from the gym, stopped at the shop to get some bread, and all of a sudden only couples everywhere. Hum.</p>
                                <p>Some online surveillance huh. Reminded me of the day I went to Starbucks with my ex and a couple of demons harassed me there, saying that they had hacked me. Oh I know, I know you are criminals and cowards.</p>
                                <p>This night in my dreams I was in ancient Egypt, maybe in Babylon, but can't remember much. I can remember though that before waking up I could kinda feel my soul coming back to my body.</p>

                         <h3>Strange things</h3>
                         <h5>By Danilo</h5>
                         <p>Had a sleep paralysis phenomena again after almost 30 years. My soul was lifted and I went up, there was a light but there was also darkness, I believe it was Christ or God, but at the moment I also was scared that it could have been something else, something evil. So I came back to my body. That was last week. Whatever that was, overall it felt divine, my body felt dormant and I really thought I was going to meet God or Christ.</p>
                         <p>On sunday night, my dog had a seisure. Awful experience. Glad he is fine now. Could have been energy related ? Could have been possession ? Or just something related to his clinging jaw that has been going for months now.</p>
                        <p>Joshua is a heavy hitter no one talks about. Chapter 23 :)</p>

                         <h3>Bday message</h3>
                         <h5>By the Scriptures</h5>
                         <p>First off, thank you for everything. Everything means health, a roof over my head, food on the table, a job, a dog and people around me. Wisdom is to accept that everything is perfect, just the way it is right now.</p>
                         <p>I have no doubt in my mind that the universe is united and commanded by a higher power, call it whatever you may call it.</p>
                         <p>For today I am thankful and grateful and that is all I want to register, really.</p>
                         <p>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;</p>
                            <br>
                         <p>A beautiful and on point translation of the word iniquity: A iniquidade vem sempre associada ao cinismo, ou seja, é a prática do mau ato sem que a pessoa que o comete assuma ou reconheça aquela ação como ato errado ou cruel. Iniquidade é o reconhecimento de normalidade em uma ação que é descabida e agressiva. </p>

                         <p>Jesus said, "Those who seek should not stop seeking until they find. When they find, they will be disturbed. When they are disturbed, they will marvel, and will reign over all. [And after they have reigned they will rest.]"</p>

                         <h5>By Danilo Mendes</h5>
                            <p>Every year around my bday, I always get a little stranger than usual :) Not sure where to begin today, if by the lacking of posts, lack of programming, volume of productiveness.</p>
                            <p>But been going down the rabbit hole of truth, the bitter pill to swallow. The deeper I go, the stranger I feel. The food demon has been strong, this lack of control in regards to food, eating a lot lately, sort of  a food disorder type of thing.</p>
                            <p>Been trying to understand the Bible and how much of it is myth and how much is truth. For now, what I can tell is that it is a book of wisdom, but also told in the form of stories and myths.</p>

                         <p>Post frequency way down, almost non existent. Reading going well, just finished Deuteronomy. Since working for Evil Corp, harassments and stalkings have decreased, of course. Just the couples narrative still.</p>

                         <p>Para hoje:</p>
                         <p>Tao não age</p>
                         <p>E por esse não agir tudo é agido</p>

                            Miss being here.
    Like I thought, less and less here.
    Corporate drone again, slave to what is ?
    Am I doing what you want ? 
    The harassments diminished, do not remember the last ones, why is that you think ?
    Really like coffee. Go to bed thinking about the morning coffee, drinking while listening to the maritacas, while trying to be closer to God. 
    There is nothing to be done, there is nothing to be fixed. 
    Taking things lightly, nothing really matters after all. Watching the dog dream while he snorts. 
    Let the being be. 
    God knows the birds are hungry, there are no hungry birds. Don’t you think he knows you are hungry too? <br>
    Passover this weekend, there will be some lamb :)

                                <h5>By Danilo Mendes</h5>
                                <p>Food demons lurking again, gotta work on that force to fight back. Good times with mama though, at least.</p>
                                <p>Trying to balance it out today, one egg, little rice and beans with one chicken breast, coffee with cream for lunch, let's see how dinner goes...after one bag of chocolate cookies last night, this is the only way.</p>
                                <p>Did not go to the gym today, feeling tired all the time...been thinking about how good exercises really are overall.</p>
                                <p>Theology school ? ha</p>
                                <p>In a dream, everybody was looking at me like the trap incident at the night club.</p>
                                <p>Been thinking about the dream that Mauricio's dad said to not give up on web development. Then another dream was very clear as soon as I woke up, but then it faded away. It was related to something professionally, maybe the fear of working for evil corp, being one more corporate drone.</p>
                                <p>If you do not realise our world has gone sick, maybe soon you will. Could I help with something ? Could I even help myself ? When we forget about ourselves and help others, our lives get fixed on their own. How can I help someone ? How to know who needs help ? </p>

                                <p>6:1 - “Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.”</p>                        </p>
                                <p>6:2 - “Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.”</p>
                                <p>6:3 - “For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.”</p>
                                <p>6:4 - “But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.”</p>
                                <p>6:5 - “For every man shall bear his own burden.”</p>
                                <p>6:6 - “Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.”</p>

                                <p>6:8 - “For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.”</p>
                                <p>6:9 - “And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.”</p>
                                <p>6:10 - “As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.”</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>And an interesting night as far as dreams:</p>
                                <p>There was a conversation with someone that I cannot recall who, about two different Bible versions, remember moving around sideways in bed, whenever a different version was brought up...weird but ok then ha 🤣 </p>
                                <p>On the other dream I was about to be murdered, some man said he was going to kill me and wrapped some tool around my neck, and when he was about to actually do it, I woke up...was not scared.</p>
                                <p>And lastly, now I realize is a recurring dream...people, all people, from family too of course, they all despise, ignore and reject me.</p>
                                <p>So interesting, really wish I could use these dreams more.</p>
                                <p>Happy sabbath everyone, stay within the law, prayed up, and sin not :) </p>

                                <h3>Difficult days</h3>
                                <h5>By Danilo Mendes</h5>
                                <p>Had a fight with mom last night. Here are the facts, you are to judge.</p>
                                <p>Went to pick her and her boss at the airport, the flight delayed, wich was fine, it was late and I was tired so I was not in the mood for much talking. So quite a silent trip, no big deal, right ? Wrong. Right after I dropped him off, she started ranting on how unpolite and uneducated I was. For what ? Not being a talkative driver ? Oh, ok then...</p>
                                <p>And she went on and on non stop, my blood got hot and I was rough asking her to be quiet. But she would not. So after a few moments I could not hold myself, those thoughts of her boss disrespecting me in the past, his harassment, his sex jokes...all her pretending and all these sick people came rushing in my mind, and I sort of lost the filter for a moment. </p>
                                <p>Told her the truth, that this is a very hard pill to swallow, that it is unreal how evil she can be, pretending that she is not part of the conspiracy...then I remember her saying: "But I gave you birth" - a phrase that I humbly told her one day, that I could not ask anything of her, because truth is she cannot give much...and I said I should thank her for giving me birth only, and nothing else.</p>
                                <p>Funny how most people confuse my humbleness with low self esteem. If my self esteem was low, I would not have been a decent athlete or professional, or whatever. I just do not care.</p>

                                <h3>Long time no talk...</h3>
                                <h5>By Danilo Mendes</h5>
                                <p>

Ok let’s write some. Been so long huh. So much to write, don't even know where to start. <br>

So the trip was challenging, gave in on some sake on Thursday. The sabbath was alright, some wine, but was not strong enough to deny shrimp. The good thing is that that was the last time I ate some shrimp. Or octopus. At least knowingly. But then this anxiety, this urge to eat, like a maniac…not sure what that was, this intense feeling of non control. Ate so many bad things, flour stuff, bread, entrees...and cannot forget about the cookies. A lot of cookies. The interesting detail is that this anxiety feeling got me eating a lot on purpose, I was not hungry but felt a strong urge to eat it anyway, and to not stop until I was completely full, almost pilking. Do not even like to remember this, total non control. So Thursday was the Japanese dinner, Friday went to lunch at a corner restaurant close to the store, Friday dinner was the shrimp defeat, Saturday was a moqueca - marvelous by the way. And ate dirty too since there was more shrimp and octopus. No more shrimp nor octopus, ever. It’s all here kids, Leviticus 11:9. <br>

Sunday, a marvelous lamb. Truly amazing. Felipe is indeed a kitchen star. Glad to see him doing well with his wife and son. The trip was mainly good to also realize they are also part of the family conspiracy, of course, how could it not. Like high up in the hierarchy, they are just more classy, sutil. One clear realization (and one of the positive things about alcohol, is that one can become more honest, perhaps) was when after being somewhat tipsy, my cousin wanted to promote, show off his wife… after she dressed up and came downstairs he called me saying: “Look Dan, look Dan!”. And petted her while looking at me. Like all the couples throw themselves at me, the “couples narrative”. Talking about couples, the narrative is still going strong, as much as possible. On the plane, a couple sat down next to me. They directed the conversation at one point mentioning a number around my net worth…and my cousin also mentioned the same number after I asked if they needed a hand with anything at the store, and he said: “we need between xxx and xxxx thousand reais”. Probably nothing huh. So now they also know my banking info. Didn’t they know all along ? Of course. No wine after Saturday, which was good. But those cookies boy, ate them like there was no tomorrow. Gym everyday but Saturday. <br>

Noticed minor directed conversations, probably once at the gym, I think that was it. And did not hear it well because of the headphones. 

Uncle incentivized working for Evil corp, of course, they can surely use one more sedated corporate drone. <br>

Participated in their Espírita religion ritual, at least it was light. Food afterwards, hopefully they did not pray on it. <br>

Sad to see my aunt, how it seems like she cannot have her own opinions. Maybe she does, but it feels like some sort of fear, like she is being trimmed, or manipulated. 

Not that I wanted but things at friday dinner got a little awkward when I was telling the story of this devil Portuguese lady from the bootcamp (it is not my business to judge whether she deserved it or not) that was able to get out of an abusive relationship. Things got weird because I said that she “also” was able to leave an abusive relationship, so they thought that I wanted to say that my aunt also experienced the same situation, which now seems true since the silence told us the truth. Maybe the silence tells us the truth sometimes. <br>

Oh boy, back full force with coffee. 4 a day…oh my poor ears. Did not read anything nor watched any relevant videos during those 5 days. Went back at eating ok since Thursday, 4 days now. Feels a little better, but for sure got fatter during the eating menace. And funny how the fat goes first to the cheese tits. Unreal, what a curse that is…or a blessing, so you keep it tight. Maybe it always depends on your perspective. <br>

So basically they want me to work for Evil corp, live with my conspiracy mother, no wife nor family. Of course, they rather see me dead first.

Having the toughest time coping with the fact that the entire (or mostly) family is evil, that my own mother is capable of conspiring, lying, pretending, being dishonest and worse, lacking character. Total chaos, unreal. 

Thankful to know the truth however, the truth that you have been monitored for a long time, that you are part of a social construct, that you have been constantly manipulated, used, played with. I am literally the "TROUXA". Flabbergasted about the reality that the sick ones are the closest. Now, THAT is a hard pill to swallow. This is why I turned to God, Jesus and the Bible, because there cannot be another way of understanding this other than understanding our history and having faith. It is very hard to believe that God does not exist. Like the phrase of the year: "The world is over, we are living in a macabre theater." <br>

I pray for all of them, all of you, even though I know you are not going to awake in time and most of us are going to pay a very high price down the road. Pray to my neighbors right here, the wife cries in the shower, they must be miserable...I wonder why they experience this…how can you succeed when you are taking part with evil ? 

Please explain to me. 

Stay hard, prayed up and sin not!

                                <p>And February...quick update, Vue course starting to make more sense, better and better each day, but need to practice, otherwise it does not stick...finished Exodus and started Leviticus now. Genesis and Exodus are very interesting, crucial and definitely deserve more attention in the near future.</p>
                                <p>Back with some coffee for now, little though, once a day, sometimes twice. Gym is going steady. I could write a book on how important the gym is and how we can see the light during leg press :)</p>
                                <p>As far as the dreams, just some apparently random stuff about job, that probably is not random at all. But nothing I could clearly connect to something or interpret somehow.</p>
                                <p>And no major harassments, just the usual couples theater. For now. But they are there, brother - the demons out there...they are always lurking 🤣💪🏻☺️</p>

                                <p>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</p>
                                <p>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>  
                                <p>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
                                <p>Charity suffereth long, and is kind, charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</p>  
                                <p>Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;</p>
                                <p>Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoice in truth;</p>

                                <p>As soon as I leave grandma's condominium, there you go, street theatre is back! Couples narrative again, at many corners 🤣</p>
                                <p>Imagine how unfortunate is to be an organized crime marionette so your job is to report and engage in street theatre. May the LORD have mercy on your soul.</p>

                                <h3>Dissembling</h3>
                                <h5>By Danilo Mendes</h5>
                                <p>Just for the record, no major noticeable stalking/harassments in the last week. Just some cheap trash talking at the gym, by some usual low life parasites. Amazing how they operate, seriously.   

                                    The same old psychological game narrative - couples/family/marriage/job/it’s over.
                                    
                                </p>   
                                <p>Now, different topic today. Let’s suppose the person you live with, regardless of the situation - relative, partner, whatever - has an annoying habit of sometimes asking you to do stuff that he/she could do it own his/her own, or just because they are too lazy to do it. 
                                    
                                    Not too bad, right ? You call them off, ask them why in the world they are asking you to do it, explain to them that THEY should do it and not ask somebody else instead...and life goes on afterwards, right ? Wrong! Because when you call them out, they are not humble enough to realize they are awkwardly annoying so instead they feel offended. And here is where it comes the serious issue.
                                    
                                    The person not only lacks humbleness but also feels offended by you calling he/she out, dissembles, argues that he/she is not asking nor outsourcing anything. Two grave errors here, the first one is being dissembling. And the major one in my opinion is dishonesty, mischievousness. 
                                    
                                    Like they say themselves, one cannot hope what the other cannot give.
                                     
                                    Boy, life is a continuing disappointment…🤣
                                    
                                    Stay hard!</p>

                                <p>In last night’s dream, the word Deuteronomy came up many times, like those fuzzy and not so clear dreams. Another bible book came as well, there were two, but cannot clearly recall the other one, perhaps Genesis.
                                <br>
                                    But the interesting thing is that there was also a chapter with it, which I believe is 28. A beautiful and cruel chapter at the same time, but with a major message in it. 
                                    <br>
                                    Thank you! ☺️

                                    <p>"You have anxiety because you have fear. You have fear because you don't know what it is to be a child of God. You have to build your spirit, build your belief system. You have to have faith in the same Christ you claim that you believe in. Is of the unfaithful. Satan developed your insecurities, so now you can have his antidotes."</p>

                                <p>First clean Xmas, alone this time, no major family resistances, only sweet messages, overall just a great regular day.</p>
                                <p>Noticed a little emotional change whenever close to people. Seeing friend Rafael and also at Taia's. Momentous, nothing new, that old fuzzy feeling from childhood.</p>
                                <p>Nice little phrase by Peter Bolland, quoting the Gita book: "How can I engage in my own struggles, in this life, with honor, dignity, reverence, self love, self respect, with love and respect for all who I meet, even with those whom I must struggle against "</p>
                                <p>In tonight's dream I was getting fired and this guy I know was going to pretty much replace me - not exactly but ok. Interesting, just read an article that dreams could help you break free out of your fears...maybe so ☺️ </p>

                                For evil are women, my children; and since they have no power or
                                strength over man, they use wiles by outward attractions, that they
                                may draw him to themselves. And whom they cannot bewitch by outward
                                attractions, him they overcome by craft. For moreover, concerning
                                them, the angel of the Lord told me, and taught me, that women are
                                overcome by the spirit of fornication more than men, and in their
                                heart they plot against men; and by means of their adornment they
                                deceive first their minds, and by the glance of the eye instill the
                                poison, and then through the accomplished act they take them
                                captive. For a woman cannot force a man openly, but by a harlot's 
                                bearing she beguiles him. Flee, therefore, fornication, my children,
                                and command your wives and your daughters, that they adorn not their
                                heads and faces to deceive the mind: because every woman who useth
                                these wiles hath been reserved for eternal punishment. For thus they
                                allured the Watchers who were before the flood; for as these
                                continually beheld them, they lusted after them, and they conceived
                                the act in their mind; for they changed themselves into the shape of
                                men, and appeared to them when they were with their husbands. And
                                the women lusting in their minds after their forms, gave birth to
                                giants, for the Watchers appeared to them as reaching even unto
                                heaven.

                                <p>“If they hate you, remember that they hated me first” - Christ</p>
                                <p>Would you stay close to a family that conspires against you ?
                                    Is it better to stay close and swallow this bitter pill or is it better to vanish. Like it is possible to vanish now with covid restrictions 🤣
                                    Te be clear here, look up words such as “Sly”,  “Mischievous” - love the sound of this one,  “Dissembling”, “Roguish” - excellent exemples of their traits. 
                                    Why this obsession with me ? Have been watched for a long time now.  From what I can tell and connecting the dots, it has been over 4 years. 
                                    Organized crime started checking on me in 2017 after a club incident (they could really think I was a cop 🤣🤷🏼‍♂️ - a misurnderstanding of course). But in 2020, after another misunderstanding inside my condominium (group of houses), things escalated abruptly. A whole lot. Fast. Like one of the harassments in Portugal, I was given the red card.
                                    Now, but how in the world did my family get involved in this ? Are they the same people ? Who are them ? Different groups of people connected by a common goal ? Is it religious ? Is it blood ? Or is it simple business connection ? Friends from church maybe ? Are they all gentiles  ? 
                                <p> Just had a conversation with my mom. Apologized for being selfish throughout these years. Personally, definitely was. However, also felt the urge to address the conspiracy they are doing. Also urged her to stop being sly and mischievous, for her own sake, for her own good. And of course, like they all do, she turned the game against me. On her own words: “I think you are paranoid and delusional, all these things you are saying are all in your head and do not exist”.
                                Patience is key, let just leave this here for now and see how things go.   </p>
                                <p>Oh and can remember a little tiny piece of tonight's dream, and the stairway spiral downwards showed up again. I think this is the 3rd time. Fascinating, whatever it may be ☺️</p> 
                                <p>And finally, today at the gym, I asked Mr. Ev to lower the music a little bit since I was not being able to hear the podcast being played in my earbuds, and of course he made it public right away, so a little bit after that the only 3 other people in the gym were talking crap to each other about it, that the music is a  "community" thing and that they could not listen to the music well. Yeah whatever, leave me alone, parasites. Music at gyms should be ambient, not a night club. And I am the wrong one...</p>

                                <h5>By Danilo Mendes</h5>
                                <p>Second time these types of dreams happened. In the first one a few weeks ago, from what I can recall was something like "walking alone going downwards", but when I was with other people the way was upwards. Interesting, and it could be true. In tonight's dream, I was in this 3 feet high flood, at a farm somewhere, and at the entrance that were 2 separate wooden gates, side by side. I was trying to help a family pass through the flood/mud with their car, but through the right side gate it seemed harder to pass as the water level seemed to be higher as we went through. So the driver backed up and went through the other gate, where the flood level seemed to be lower. The driver then sped up the car and was able to pass through the flood at a high speed. I looked to the car and in the back of the trunk were two kids (boys maybe). How mysterious is that ? Is my subconscious tricking me ? Are these my fears ? Is this a message from HIM ? Is it nothing ? Or what is it ? </p>
                                <p>At the same time these dreams happen, maybe my ego wants to isolate me.</p>
                                <p>Would you be around the ones that persecute you ?</p>

                                <h3>Old man's birthday</h3>
                                <h5>By Danilo Mendes</h5>
                                <p>Called the man to wish him a happy birthday. Last time we talked he suggested I should take a test to work for the federal police. Unreal, probably nothing 🤣. Told mom about this and the look in her face, she looked to the left upper hand side like liers do, so I knew something was up. Bottom line is that my family is punishing me for being on my own and not caring about the community - them included. I am a persona non grata to everyone. My aunt indirectly called me self-centered in the family group chat. And laughed. Aren't we all self centered ? Aren't we all selfish ? They claim I am a monster, but what are they ? Families united against one's crucifixion ? For what ? Are they playing God ? Are they entitled to social justice ? I have been selfish, a wrong doer and a bad person with a bad character, yes. I am not "coitadinho", like everyone is saying. But if I have to be judged, God is the one to do so, not us. And I can be this awful person, but I am not an evil one. I will never do anything close to somebody as to what my loved ones are doing right now. And they think they are doing "justice"...they must feel great about it. Back at our today's conversation, at least the man was honest. I can take honesty and truth, as harsh as it can be. His own words "For us, your presence does not make any difference". And that is truth, I can take truth. Isn't the other way around also true ? Isn't it natural, or "normal" from all humans ? Also his own words: "You deserve to be punished and to not see anyone. I don't know how your mom lets you stay in her house". How can so much hatred come out of this man's mouth ? Could tell the talk was going to go towards the vaccine too and we know how that goes. After calling me names, he hanged the telephone up in my face.</p>
                                <p>Unfortunately cannot take the man seriously. Most of them too. Like Christ said, forgive them because they do not know what they are doing.</p>
                                <p>Crazy times we are living in, folks.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Yesterday this song got a few tears out of my eyes...

                            <p>So grateful for this wonderful Saturday of "rest". Cutting the grass, giving the dog a shower, shaving my head,
                                walking the dog, telling the neighbor she left the car light's on, feeling the nature and the gratitude of it
                                all, cooking some food, drinking a can of soda, having a perfect lunch, drinking a cup of coffee, learning about
                                psychology and the bible, writing down the most important points of Jordan Peterson's video (tough because
                                pretty much the whole thing is important)...</p>
                            <p>Anyhow, just thank You! 🙌🏻 🤠</p>
                            <p>Every single human being regardless of their peculiarities and strangeness and sins and crimes, has something divine
                                in them that needs to be regarded with respect.</p>

                        <h3>Noah and the Flood</h3>
                        <h5>By Jordan Peterson</h5>
                        <p>There is no better pathway to self-realization and the annulment of being than to posit the highest good that you can
                            conceive of and commit yourself to it. And then you might ask yourself, do you really have
                            anything better to do ? And then if you don’t, why would you do anything else ?
                        
                            If you orient yourself properly and then pay attention to what you do everyday, that works. It is in accordance with
                            what we understand about human perception because what happens is that the world shifts itself around your aim, you
                            are a creature that has an aim, you have to have an aim in order to do something, and that sets up the world around
                            you, it organizes all your perceptions, organizes what you see and what you don't see, it organizes your emotions
                            and your motivations.
                        
                            So you organize yourself around that aim and then the day manifests itself as a set of challenges and problems and
                            if you solve them properly then you stay on the pathway towards that aim and you can concentrate on the day. So you
                            can have your cake and eat it too. You can point to the far distance but you can live in the day.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Stumbled upon this...</h3>
                        <p>Achilles was a hero of the Trojan War, the greatest of all the Greek warriors. Achilles was invulnerable in all
                            of his body except for one heel, because when his mother Thetis dipped him in
                            the river Styx as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term "Achilles'
                            heel" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong
                            constitution. The Achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends.</p>

                                1 - Externals I cannot control <br>
